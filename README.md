Pomodoro Timer App

This is a Pomodoro timer application that allows users to track their work sessions using the Pomodoro technique. Users can log in using their Google account and start a 25-minute timer. When the timer is complete, a 5-minute break timer will begin. The user can reset, pause, and start the timer as needed.

Timer Functionality

When the user logs in to the application, they will see a 25-minute timer displayed on the screen. The user can click the start button to start the timer, and the timer will count down from 25 minutes. If the user needs to take a break or pause the timer, they can click the pause button. If they want to reset the timer to 25 minutes, they can click the reset button.

When the 25-minute timer is complete, a 5-minute break timer will begin. The user can start, pause, reset, and stop the break timer just like they can with the work timer.
